# Wine_Quality_Linear_Regression_Neural_Networks
An example linear regression/deep learning project where regression and neural networks were used to find the correlations and a predictive model of wine quality based on numerous variables

- Using Kaggle data from real tests of quality, a linear regression model and neural network were created based on eleven numerical variables
- Linear regression model has a testing score of .434 or 43.4% 
- A neural network was thus created to improve the overall accuracy of a wine quality regression model based on the eleven variables
